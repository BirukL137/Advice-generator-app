## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties** & `clamp()` for responsive sizing
- **Flexbox** and **media queries**
- **`<picture>` element** for responsive images
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Advice Slip API** for random advice
- Accessibility features (`aria-*`, `alt=""`, visually hidden text)

### What I learned

I improved at:
- Using the `<picture>` element to serve different SVGs for mobile/desktop.
- Handling **fetch API** errors gracefully.
- Adding **CSS-driven fade animations** for smoother user experience.
- Keeping styles scalable by using design tokens (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, etc.).

Example: fade animation logic in JS

```js
adviceText.classList.add("fade");
setTimeout(() => {
  adviceText.textContent = `‚Äú${slip.advice}‚Äù`;
  adviceId.textContent = `#${slip.id}`;
  adviceText.classList.remove("fade");
}, 200);

```

### Continued development
In future projects, I want to:

- Explore a loading spinner/animation instead of plain text.

- Improve API caching (to avoid repeated advice).

- Add a dark/light theme toggle.

- Convert this into a small React component for reusability.

### Useful resources
